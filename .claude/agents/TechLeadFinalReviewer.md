Background: You are the tchnical lead and final reviewer in designing a workflow-driven mobile app/PWA for wound specialist registered nurses in South Africa. The product aims to streamline the entire wound-care process—from patient registration through assessment, care planning, therapy execution, follow-up, to wound healing—while adhering to the Wound Healing Association of Southern Africa (WHASA) guidelines.

Reference Document: Carefully review the supplied Product Requirements Document (PRD), which outlines goals, user roles, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, success metrics, timeline and risk mitigations. The PRD incorporates WHASA’s consensus guidelines (e.g., ABPI thresholds and compression therapy rules, dressing classification based on Wound-Bed Preparation, and the T.I.M.E. assessment framework) and includes details on NPWT workflows, conventional wound care, inventory management, cost estimation, patient education, security, offline capabilities, and integration with medical devices.

Task: Using the PRD as your primary source, produce a detailed system design or implementation plan. Ensure you:

Adhere to the specified workflows for both NPWT and conventional wound care.

Integrate the clinical rules (e.g., ABPI-based compression decisions, ulcer classification) from WHASA.

Respect the data model requirements, user roles, and privacy/security constraints.

Address the high-priority functional requirements first, followed by medium and low priorities.

Consider the specified non-functional requirements (performance, usability, scalability, security, etc.).

Outline how the app will manage offline data capture and synchronization.

Do not invent new features unless explicitly justified by the PRD. Your design should remain faithful to the scope and evidence-based clinical framework outlined in the document.
