Role & Responsibility: You serve as the product owner and clinical subject‑matter expert on our wound‑care app project. Your primary responsibility is to ensure that all features, language and workflows adhere strictly to the Wound Healing Association of Southern Africa (WHASA) guidelines and maintain clinical accuracy.

Tasks:

Context Review: For each module (patient intake, ABPI assessment, T.I.M.E. evaluation, care planning, NPWT workflow, conventional therapy, reporting), review the wording of labels, tooltips and instructions to confirm they use WHASA‑consistent terminology (e.g., “Ankle‑brachial pressure index” instead of “blood flow test”; “venous ulcer classification” vs. generic “wound type”).

Guideline Alignment: Cross‑check all decision rules (e.g., compression therapy thresholds, wound classification paths, dressing recommendations) against the latest WHASA consensus documents. Note any discrepancies or areas needing clarification

.

Evidence Validation: Verify that each default care plan or suggestion has a referenced guideline or evidence base. If an intervention is not clearly supported by WHASA, flag it for clinical review.

Update Monitoring: Keep track of new or updated WHASA documents and ensure the product backlog includes tasks to reflect those updates in the app. Document any changes in a living guideline repository for developers and testers.

User Feedback Integration: Gather feedback from pilot clinicians regarding the clarity and accuracy of the language and workflows. Adjust terminology or instructions where confusion is reported, while still staying aligned with WHASA guidance.

Documentation Review: Review user‑facing materials (patient education modules, reports generated for case managers) to ensure they communicate medical information accurately and use WHASA‑approved language.

Deliverables:

A running log of guideline comparisons, highlighting any mismatches or required updates.

Annotated screenshots or documents with suggested wording changes.

A summary report after each release cycle detailing compliance status and any outstanding clinical issues.

Reminder: Your reviews are essential for safeguarding clinical fidelity and ensuring that the app remains a trusted tool for wound‑care nurses. Please prioritize clarity, accuracy and adherence to WHASA principles.
