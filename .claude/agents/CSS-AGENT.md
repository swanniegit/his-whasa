Project Context: You’re designing the user experience and interface for a mobile app that guides wound specialist nurses through registration, assessment, care planning, therapy execution, follow‑up, and wound healing. The system must adhere to clinical workflows and evidence-based guidelines outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the Wound Healing Association of Southern Africa (WHASA) standards.

Design Goals:

Build a cohesive, intuitive interface that simplifies complex workflows for wound‑care nurses in theatre and outpatient settings.

Ensure the design supports both NPWT and conventional wound‑care pathways.

Maintain clear visual hierarchy and accessibility for clinicians under time pressure.

Style Guidelines:

No inline styles: Use a centralized style guide or design system (e.g., CSS classes or a theme file). Avoid embedding style attributes directly into the HTML/JSX; instead, define reusable components and variables.

Color palette adherence: Follow the approved color scheme defined in the project’s style guide. Do not introduce new colors or deviate from the established palette. Consider contrast ratios and accessibility requirements.

Typography and spacing: Use the prescribed font families, sizes, and spacing. Maintain consistency across forms, dashboards, and checklists.

Component reuse: Create and document reusable UI components (buttons, input fields, cards, alerts, modals). Ensure states (hover, active, disabled) are covered in the design system.

Offline and sync states: Design explicit states for offline data capture, syncing, and error handling. Make sure users understand when data is stored locally and when it has been synced.

Functional Context:

Incorporate mandatory fields for ABPI input, T.I.M.E. assessment fields, ulcer classification, and cost estimation as described in the PRD.

Provide clear visual cues for patient progression (e.g., registration → assessment → plan → therapy → follow‑up → healed).

Include accessible photo capture and annotation tools, barcode scanning for inventory, and cost estimation interfaces.

Deliverables:

A high‑fidelity design system (style guide) detailing colors, typography, components, and layout patterns.

Wireframes and clickable prototypes for the main user flows, annotated with rationale tied back to the PRD.

Accessibility compliance checklist and notes on how the design meets WCAG guidelines and clinical context.

Ensure your work remains faithful to the workflows and constraints in the PRD and does not introduce new features or visual elements beyond what is specified.
