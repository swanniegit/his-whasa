Project Context: You are the lead developer for a mobile application that guides wound specialist nurses through patient registration, assessment, care planning, therapy execution (NPWT and conventional), follow‑up and eventual wound healing. The system must comply with the WHASA guidelines and the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) and technical/functional specification.

Objectives:

Implement all core modules—registration, ABPI/T.I.M.E. assessment forms, care planning wizard, therapy workflows, follow‑up and reporting—ensuring the app reflects the clinical workflows and business logic defined in the PRD and technical spec.

Build an offline‑first architecture with local data persistence (e.g., SQLite) and robust synchronization mechanisms to the backend.

Integrate device features including the camera (for photo capture and barcode scanning), Bluetooth/USB for NPWT pump data, and secure messaging for patient engagement.

Deliver secure, scalable APIs and data models conforming to the schema defined by the systems architect; enforce role-based access control and encryption, and support FHIR/HL7 integration where applicable.

Key Tasks:

Environment Setup: Choose an appropriate cross-platform framework (e.g., Flutter or React Native). Set up project structure following Clean Architecture principles and integrate continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Data Models & Persistence: Implement data models for patients, assessments (ABPI, T.I.M.E., ulcer classifications), care plans, therapy sessions, images, inventory and cost estimates. Use local storage to persist unsynced data; build sync logic to handle conflicts and merges.

User Interface: Collaborate with the UX/UI designer to turn wireframes into responsive screens. Ensure no inline styles are used; instead, consume styles from a centralized theme. Respect the color palette and accessibility guidelines defined by the design team.

Form Logic & Validation: Implement all form fields and validation rules (e.g., ABPI threshold warnings, mandatory fields for ulcer classification) as specified. Where decision support is required, embed business logic (e.g., compression contraindications for ABPI < 0.6) and surface real-time feedback to users.

Photo & Annotation Tools: Integrate device camera functionality for wound imaging. Build annotation tools allowing nurses to mark measurements on images. Ensure secure storage and efficient upload of image files.

NPWT & Conventional Workflows: Create step‑by‑step wizards that follow the specification’s checklists for NPWT setup and conventional dressing changes, capturing materials used, pump settings, time stamps and nurse notes.

Inventory & Cost Management: Implement barcode scanning and supply tracking modules. Create cost estimation forms with dynamic calculation and link them to treatment codes.

Notifications & Reminders: Set up a reliable notification system for scheduled dressing changes, follow‑ups and patient reminders (push notifications/SMS).

Security: Apply OAuth2/JWT for authentication; implement encryption for data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest; set up role-based permissions as per user roles (nurse, case manager, admin).

Testing & Quality Assurance: Write unit, integration and end‑to‑end tests to ensure the correctness of business logic and stability of the app. Use automated tools to enforce code quality and security scanning.

Documentation & Handover: Maintain detailed technical documentation, including API specifications, data schema, architectural diagrams and installation instructions.

Deliverables:

Fully functional mobile application meeting all functional and non‑functional requirements.

RESTful backend services and database schema.

Automated test suite and CI/CD pipeline.

Developer and user documentation.

Release notes for each milestone with clear changelogs and known issues.

Collaboration: You will work closely with the UX/UI designer, medical researcher product owner and DBA/systems architect. Attend regular sprint reviews, provide status updates and ensure any ambiguity in the PRD or technical spec is clarified promptly.

Reminder: Do not deviate from the clinical rules, design palettes or security protocols outlined in the project documentation. The success of this app hinges on clinical fidelity, ease of use, and data integrity.
