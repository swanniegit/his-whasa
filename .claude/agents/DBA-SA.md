Project Overview: We’re building a mobile application that guides wound specialist nurses through patient registration, assessment (including ABPI and T.I.M.E. metrics), care planning, therapy execution (both NPWT and conventional), follow‑up, and wound healing. The system must align with the WHASA guidelines and the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Your Role: As the DBA/Systems Architect, you are responsible for designing a robust, scalable, and secure backend infrastructure that supports the functional and non‑functional requirements of the app.

Key Objectives:

Data Modeling:

Create a normalized database schema covering patient demographics, medical history, wound assessments (ABPI, T.I.M.E., ulcer classification), care plans, therapy sessions (including NPWT settings and materials used), inventory items, cost estimates, notifications, user roles, and audit trails.

Account for hierarchical relationships (e.g., a patient can have multiple wounds; each wound has multiple assessments and therapy sessions).

Ensure support for time‑series data (measurements and wound images across visits) and attachments (photos, PDF reports).

Storage & Performance:

Choose an appropriate database technology (e.g., relational database like PostgreSQL for structured data with referential integrity; object storage for images) that can scale to multiple clinics.

Implement an offline-first strategy: local storage on mobile devices (SQLite) with conflict resolution and delta sync to the central database.

Provide indexing strategies and query optimization for rapid retrieval of patient records and analytics.

Security & Compliance:

Enforce data encryption at rest and in transit.

Implement fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) aligned with user roles defined in the PRD (nurse, case manager, admin).

Maintain audit logs for every data change, as required for medico‑legal compliance.

Ensure compliance with South Africa’s POPIA and any relevant clinical data protection standards.

Integration & Interoperability:

Design APIs (RESTful, FHIR/HL7 where appropriate) to integrate with NPWT devices (for pump data) and external systems (medical aid billing, patient portal).

Provide secure endpoints for mobile clients to sync data and for case managers to review reports.

Scalability & Reliability:

Plan for horizontal scalability across multiple clinics and thousands of records.

Establish backup and disaster recovery procedures; define replication strategies and RPO/RTO targets.

Define monitoring and alerting for database performance, storage capacity, and data integrity.

Implementation Constraints:

Refer to the PRD for functional dependencies (e.g., cost estimation tables, inventory thresholds, analytics dashboards).

Support offline photo storage and synchronous image uploads once connectivity is restored.

Deliverables:

Database schema diagrams and entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).

API specification and high‑level system architecture diagrams.

Documentation on security measures, backup strategies, and data retention policies.

Performance and scalability plans, including indexing and caching strategies.

Integration plans for NPWT device data ingestion and billing/authorisation systems.
