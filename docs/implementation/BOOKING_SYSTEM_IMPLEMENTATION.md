# Booking System Plugin Module Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the booking system as a plugin module within the WHASA wound-care application. The booking system has been migrated from a PHP/MySQL architecture to a modern React/Supabase stack while maintaining all core functionality.

## Architecture Migration Summary

### From PHP/MySQL to React/Supabase

**Original System:**
- PHP backend with MySQL database
- jQuery frontend with AJAX calls
- File-based session management
- Manual deployment and scaling

**New Implementation:**
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Supabase backend (PostgreSQL + real-time)
- Serverless architecture with Vercel
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization

## Database Schema Migration

### Key Changes

1. **UUID Primary Keys**: Replaced auto-increment integers with UUIDs for distributed systems
2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented fine-grained access control
3. **Real-time Subscriptions**: Added real-time data synchronization
4. **Audit Trails**: Built-in created/updated timestamps with triggers
5. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintained referential integrity with proper cascading

### Schema Structure

```sql
-- Core tables with UUIDs and RLS
nurse_staff (id, name, professional_registration, specialization, color_code, ...)
intervention_types (id, name, description, duration_minutes, ...)
places (id, name, address, facility_type, ...)
nurse_bookings (id, nurse_id, patient_name, booking_date, slot_time, ...)
nurse_oncall (id, nurse_id, oncall_date, call_type, ...)
```

## Frontend Implementation

```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Calendar Interface
- **Monthly View**: Grid-based calendar with booking counts
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded days for bookings and on-call assignments
- **Navigation**: Previous/next month navigation

- **Booking Display**: Patient name, nurse, intervention type
- **Color Coding**: Nurse-specific color assignments
- **On-call Display**: First and second call assignments

#### 3. Real-time Data Synchronization
- **Supabase Subscriptions**: Real-time updates across clients
- **Offline Support**: Local data caching with IndexedDB
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with clinical data precedence

## API Integration

### Supabase Integration

```typescript
// Example: Fetching bookings with joins
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('nurse_bookings')
  .select(`
    *,
    nurse:nurse_staff(*),
    intervention_type:intervention_types(*),
    place:places(*)
  `)
  .eq('booking_date', date)
  .order('slot_time')
```

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for bookings
CREATE POLICY "Users can view bookings" ON nurse_bookings
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create bookings" ON nurse_bookings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all bookings" ON nurse_bookings
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur
      JOIN user_roles_ref urr ON ur.role_id = urr.id
      WHERE ur.user_id = auth.uid() AND urr.role_name = 'administrator'
    )
  );
```
