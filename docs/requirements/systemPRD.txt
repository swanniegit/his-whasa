Product Title
Workflow‑Driven Wound‑Care Nurse Practitioner App

Executive Summary
Wound specialist nurses in South Africa manage a complex workload that encompasses patient registration, assessment, therapy planning, execution and follow‑up. WHASA’s consensus guidelines emphasise a structured process involving comprehensive vascular assessment, individualised care planning, treatment of underlying causes and regular reassessment
safpj.co.za
. Existing practices rely heavily on paper forms and manual calculation, which slow workflows and increase the risk of oversight. This product aims to deliver a mobile app that automates these workflows, ensuring evidence‑based care, better documentation, supply management and patient engagement.

Goals & Objectives
Streamline Wound‑Care Workflow: Provide a single interface guiding nurses through the entire process from patient registration to wound healing, ensuring no critical step is missed.

Improve Documentation Quality: Digitally capture clinical data, photographs and care plans aligned with WHASA’s wound‑care assessment forms
whasa.org
whasa.org
.

Support Evidence‑Based Decisions: Embed clinical rules from WHASA guidelines (e.g., ABPI thresholds, compression indications, dressing classification)
safpj.co.za
whasa.org
.

Enhance Patient Engagement: Deliver tailored education and reminders to patients and carers to improve adherence and outcomes.

Reduce Operational Burden: Integrate inventory management, cost estimation and automated reporting to reduce administrative tasks.

Target Users & Use Cases
Primary Users
Wound specialist registered nurses working in hospital theatres, outpatient clinics and community health practices. They require timely decision support, standardized documentation and efficient supply management.

Secondary Users
Case managers/medical aids who need clear documentation and cost estimates for authorisation.

Patients and carers who require education, follow‑up reminders and secure communication.

Other clinicians (e.g., vascular surgeons, diabetic foot specialists) who may consult via the app.

Core Use Cases
Patient Registration & Intake: Nurse captures demographics, medical history and risk factors as per WHASA’s assessment form
whasa.org
.

Wound Assessment: Nurse performs T.I.M.E. assessment (Tissue, Infection/inflammation, Moisture, Edge), records ABPI, ulcer classification and associated factors
whasa.org
.

Care Plan Creation: System suggests evidence‑based interventions based on wound type and patient factors, using WHASA’s dressing classification
whasa.org
.

Therapy Execution: Nurse follows step‑by‑step checklist for NPWT or conventional wound care, records materials used, wound photographs and pain scores.

Follow‑up & Monitoring: Nurse schedules visits, tracks healing progress and receives alerts for overdue dressing changes or deteriorating wounds
safpj.co.za
.

Patient Education: System delivers education modules tailored to ulcer type and records patient adherence.

Inventory & Cost Management: Nurse scans supplies, monitors stock levels and generates cost estimates for each treatment episode
whasa.org
.

Reporting & Billing: System generates structured reports for medical aid review and stores them securely.

Non‑Functional Requirements (Summary)
Usability: Intuitive interface designed for clinical environments; offline capability with sync.

Performance: Sub‑2 second screen load time on mid‑range devices.

Security: POPIA compliance, encryption in transit and at rest, role‑based access control and audit trails.

Scalability: Support multiple clinics and thousands of patient records.

Device Integration: Support Bluetooth connectivity to NPWT pumps and barcode scanners.

Success Metrics & KPIs
Workflow Efficiency: Reduce time spent on documentation per patient by ≥30 % compared with paper forms.

Clinical Compliance: ≥95 % of assessments include ABPI when indicated
whasa.org
 and T.I.M.E. components
whasa.org
.

Healing Outcomes: Achieve reduction in average healing time for venous and arterial ulcers by 10 % within 6 months of deployment.

User Adoption: ≥80 % of wound specialist nurses in the pilot site actively use the app within one month.

Inventory Accuracy: Reduce supply stock‑outs by 90 % through automated alerts.

Milestones & Timeline (Indicative)
Discovery & Design (4 weeks): Finalise user journeys, wireframes and data models. Validate with clinical stakeholders.

MVP Development (8 weeks): Build core modules (registration, assessment, care planning, NPWT & conventional workflows). Integrate offline storage and sync.

Pilot Testing (4 weeks): Deploy to pilot clinic; collect feedback; iterate on usability and clinical validity.

Full Release (6 weeks): Add inventory management, cost estimation, patient portal and analytics. Prepare documentation and training materials.

Key Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Clinical rule errors	Incorrect therapy recommendations could harm patients.	Rigorously validate decision rules against WHASA guidelines and perform user acceptance testing with wound specialists.
Data privacy breach	Unauthorized disclosure of patient data violates POPIA.	Implement encryption, strict access controls and regular security audits.
User adoption	Nurses may resist digital systems.	Involve clinicians early in design, offer training and emphasise time‑saving benefits.
Device integration issues	NPWT pumps may not standardise communication protocols.	Engage device manufacturers to access APIs; provide manual entry fallback.
